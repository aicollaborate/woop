# scripts/apple-signing/with-timestamp-retry.sh
#
# Wrap a command in a retry loop that survives Apple RFC 3161 timestamp
# service transient failures ("A timestamp was expected but was not found" /
# "The timestamp service is not available"). Apple's timestamp endpoints
# (timestamp.apple.com / ts01) are intermittently unreachable; per memory
# `flowix-release-build-detached-timestamp-retry`, retrying with backoff is
# the supported workaround.
#
# Only retries when the wrapped command's exit code + stderr matches one of
# the known timestamp failure signatures. Any other failure aborts
# immediately — we never silently swallow real errors.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/apple-signing/with-timestamp-retry.sh -- <cmd ...>
#
# Env vars:
#   TIMESTAMP_RETRY_MAX       max attempts (default 8)
#   TIMESTAMP_RETRY_BACKOFF   initial backoff seconds, doubles each retry
#                             (default 15)
